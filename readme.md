# Setlister

Plugin for [beets](https://github.com/sampsyo/beets) to generate playlists from the setlists of a given artist, using [setlist.fm](http://www.setlist.fm)


## Usage
1. Clone this project, or download [setlister.py](beetsplug/setlister.py), in to your configured pluginpath (e.g., `~/.beets`)
2. Add `setlister` to your configured beets plugins
3. Register for a setlist.fm API key [here](https://www.setlist.fm/settings/api)
4. Configure setlister to know where your playlists have to be placed
```yaml
setlister:
    playlist_dir: ~/Music/setlists
    api_key: <YOUR API KEY HERE>
```
Now you can run `$ beets setlister artist` to download the artists' latest setlist to your configured playlist directory, or specify the concert date using the `--date` option.
